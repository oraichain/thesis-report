## Conclusion

Whale activity on Hyperliquid reveals a cautiously bearish stance on the broader market, with particular conviction on ETH shorts and selective altcoin positioning. The market appears to be in a consolidation phase following recent volatility, with liquidity gaps suggesting potential for rapid price movements in either direction.

The most consistent pattern observed is the preference for BTC over ETH and select altcoins, suggesting relative strength in BTC may continue. Traders should maintain appropriate risk management given the concentrated liquidation points visible in liquidity data.

Short-term trades should focus on areas of whale consensus, particularly where positioning aligns with technical support/resistance and liquidity analysis. The highest conviction signal remains the ETH short bias demonstrated by several top-performing wallets.
