The pool generates significant fees from consistent volume, with deep liquidity allowing efficient trades. Price has been maintaining a channel between $50-$65 with 63% daily APR primarily from trading fees.

### High-Risk Pools

#### 7. WSOL/TRUMP (GQsPr4RJk9AZkkfWHud7v4MtotcxhaYzZHdsPCg9vNvW)

- **TVL**: $3.34M
- **APR**: 264.15% (Day), 128.11% (Week), 60.76% (Month)

- **Correlation Coefficient**: 0.42 (weak correlation)
- **Market Trend**: Highly volatile with erratic price spikes
- **Technical Indicators**: Multiple gaps in price action
- **Risk Level**: ❌ High
- **Price Range Recommendation**: $9.09-$12.80 (±20%)
- **Risk Management**: Smaller position size, limit exposure

**Analysis**: This pool offers the highest APR among our recommendations but with significantly elevated risk. TRUMP token showed extreme volatility with 1000%+ daily APR spikes in recent history. Liquidity is heavily imbalanced, with most TRUMP liquidity concentrated on the downside. The political narrative driving this token makes price prediction particularly challenging.

#### 8. WSOL/GRASS (GTJ2S27UL7yZ3TdTwpKjfNcxeEZRkRPHjpj5Fubwb8Mk)

- **TVL**: $1.60M
- **APR**: 256.15% (Day), 60.89% (Week), 94.01% (Month)
- **Volume (24h)**: $4.50M
- **Correlation Coefficient**: 0.38 (weak correlation)
- **Market Trend**: Volatile uptrend with significant retracements
- **Technical Indicators**: High RSI indicates potential for correction
- **Risk Level**: ❌ High
- **Price Range Recommendation**: $75.55-$93.95 (±15%)
- **Risk Management**: Take partial profits during volatility spikes

**Analysis**: GRASS token demonstrates exceptional APR potential but with extreme volatility risk. The liquidity is heavily skewed with most GRASS concentrated on the downside. Daily APR fluctuations between 20-250% indicate high unpredictability. The pool has substantially higher expected impermanent loss compared to other options.

## Liquidity Depth Analysis

The analyzed pools show significant differences in liquidity distribution:

1. **Stablecoin and LST pairs** (USDC/USDT, WSOL/mSOL, WSOL/JitoSOL) demonstrate balanced liquidity with healthy depth on both sides of the current price.

2. **WSOL/USDC** shows asymmetric depth with substantially more USDC liquidity on the downside ($5.5M) compared to WSOL on the upside ($661K), reflecting market expectations of potential SOL price movements.

3. **Meme and speculation tokens** (TRUMP, GRASS) show severe liquidity imbalances, with liquidity heavily concentrated to protect against downside movements, reflecting higher risk assessments.

## LP Strategies By Risk Preference

- **Primary Allocation**: 70% to stablecoin and LST pairs
- **Position Sizing**: Large positions within narrow ranges
- **Rebalancing**: Monthly or during significant deviations
- **Entry Method**: Single concentrated position near current price

### Balanced Strategy (Medium Risk)

- **Primary Allocation**: 60% to WSOL/USDC and LAYER/USDC
- **Position Sizing**: Moderate positions with wider ranges
- **Rebalancing**: Bi-weekly or after 5%+ price moves
- **Entry Method**: Staggered positions at key support levels

### Aggressive Strategy (High Risk)

- **Primary Allocation**: 30% to WSOL/TRUMP and WSOL/GRASS

## Impermanent Loss Mitigation

| Pool Type      | IL Risk   | Mitigation Strategy                        |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Stablecoin/LST | Minimal   | Ultra-narrow ranges (±0.5-1%)              |
| SOL/USD        | Moderate  | Range borders at technical S/R levels      |
| SOL/Altcoin    | High      | Wider ranges, lower position sizes         |
| SOL/Meme       | Very High | Take profits frequently, small allocations |

## Conclusion

Raydium's concentrated liquidity pools offer diverse opportunities across the risk spectrum. For optimal results:

1. **Low-risk investors** should focus on stablecoin and LST pairs with tight ranges
2. **Medium-risk investors** can achieve substantial yields with WSOL/USDC and LAYER/USDC
3. **High-risk investors** may explore meme and speculative pairs for exceptional but volatile returns

The most balanced approach combines allocations across risk categories with proper position sizing and regular monitoring. Remember that higher APRs correspond directly with elevated risk profiles and potential impermanent loss.

For all positions, monitoring price trends and adjusting ranges when needed is essential for maximizing returns while managing risk effectively.
