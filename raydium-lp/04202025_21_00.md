   - TVL (Total Value Locked) stability
   - Liquidity depth distribution

3. **Risk Assessment**

## Impermanent Loss Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Concentrated Liquidity Range Optimization

For each recommended pool, we suggest the following approach to range setting:

- **Low-Risk Pools**: Set tight ranges (±0.5% to ±3%) to maximize capital efficiency
- **Medium-Risk Pools**: Use moderately wide ranges (±8% to ±15%) to balance yield and IL risk
- **Higher-Risk Pools**: Consider either very narrow ranges with active management or wider ranges (±20%+) with smaller allocations

### 2. Correlation-Based Portfolio Construction

Allocate larger percentages to highly correlated pairs:

- WSOL/mSOL and WSOL/JitoSOL (correlation >0.95)
- Stablecoin pairs (correlation >0.99)

For medium-correlated pairs (0.6-0.8), limit exposure and implement tighter ranges.

### 3. Rebalancing Strategy

Implement a systematic rebalancing approach:

- **Low-Risk Pools**: Review monthly or during significant market events
- **Medium-Risk Pools**: Review bi-weekly
- **Higher-Risk Pools**: Review weekly and after >10% price movements

## Conclusion

Raydium's concentrated liquidity pools offer compelling opportunities across the risk spectrum. By carefully selecting pools based on token fundamentals, market trends, and liquidity characteristics, LPs can optimize returns while managing impermanent loss risk.

The most attractive current opportunities are:

1. **Conservative Allocation**: USDS/USDC, WSOL/mSOL, WSOL/JitoSOL
2. **Balanced Allocation**: WSOL/USDC, RAY/USDC
3. **Growth-Oriented**: WSOL/ALCH, WSOL/Fartcoin (with appropriate risk management)

We recommend a diversified approach, allocating capital across multiple risk categories based on individual risk tolerance and investment goals.
