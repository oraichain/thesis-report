The analysis leverages multiple data points including APR, trading volume, price volatility, TVL, pair correlation, and liquidity depth to identify optimal LP opportunities.

   - WSOL has strong support around $95-98 and resistance at $130-135.
   - RAY has shown support at $1.35-1.40 and resistance at $1.80-2.00.

   - Stablecoins maintain RSI near 50, indicating equilibrium.

## Conclusion

The optimal Raydium LP strategy in the current market environment balances exposure across risk categories, with a preference for:

1. Stablecoin pairs for capital preservation (USDS/USDC, USDC/USDT)
2. Correlated pairs for reduced impermanent loss (WSOL/mSOL, WSOL/JitoSOL)
3. Strategic high-volume pairs for enhanced returns (WSOL/USDC)

For most investors, a balanced portfolio approach is recommended, with position sizing weighted toward lower-risk pools in the current market conditions. Regular monitoring and range adjustment will be crucial as market trends evolve.

This strategy optimizes for sustainable returns while managing downside risk through diversification, correlation analysis, and strategic range setting.
