## Pool Selection Methodology

### Quantitative Filter Criteria

Initial screening of 300+ pools was conducted using the following quantitative filters:

1. **Liquidity & Volume**:

   - Minimum TVL threshold: $400,000
   - Minimum daily volume: $300,000 or Volume/TVL ratio > 0.2
   - Fee tier relevance to volatility profile

2. **Price Stability Analysis**:

   - Historical price volatility (30-day range)
   - Mean reversion tendency
   - Support/resistance strength

3. **Correlation & Market Analysis**:
   - Correlation coefficient stability
   - Directional bias alignment
   - Market trend analysis for constituent tokens

### Technical Indicator Overlay

For shortlisted pools, we applied the following technical analysis:

1. **Moving Averages**: 7-day, 30-day, 50-day
2. **RSI**: Current value and trend direction
3. **Bollinger Bands**: Width and current price position
4. **Volume Profile**: Concentration points and key levels
5. **Liquidity Depth Analysis**: Distribution of liquidity across price ranges

### Risk-Adjusted Return Model

Final recommendations incorporate a proprietary risk-adjusted return model:

```
Risk-Adjusted Score = (Fee APR × Volume Stability) ÷ (IL Risk × Price Volatility)
```

Where:

- Fee APR = Historical fee generation
- Volume Stability = Coefficient of variation of daily volume
- IL Risk = Maximum impermanent loss in 30-day historical range
- Price Volatility = Standard deviation of daily returns

## Optimal Liquidity Deployment Strategies

We've identified three distinct deployment strategies that optimize capital efficiency based on pool characteristics:

### 1. Narrow Range Strategy (For Stablecoins & LSTs)

For pools like USDS/USDC and WSOL/mSOL with high correlation and low volatility:

- **Implementation**: Concentrate 100% of liquidity within ±0.5% (stables) or ±3% (LSTs) of current price
- **Rebalancing Trigger**: Price movement beyond 80% of chosen range
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Maximized trading fee capture
  - Near-zero impermanent loss
  - Capital utilization >90%

### 2. Barbell Strategy (For Medium Volatility Pairs)

For pools like WSOL/USDC and RAY/USDC with moderate volatility and defined ranges:

- **Implementation**:
  - 70% of liquidity within ±8% of current price
  - 15% at support zone (lower boundary)
  - 15% at resistance zone (upper boundary)
- **Rebalancing Trigger**: Price movement beyond main concentration band
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Optimized fee capture during normal trading
  - Positioned to capture volatility spikes
  - Reduced impermanent loss risk

### 3. Cluster Strategy (For High Volatility Pairs)

For pools like ZEUS/WSOL and ALCH/WSOL with high volatility and multiple trading ranges:

- **Implementation**:
  - Multiple concentrated positions at key liquidity nodes
  - Position sizes weighted by probability of price action
  - Focus on support/resistance levels
- **Rebalancing Trigger**: Price movement beyond cluster boundaries
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - Balanced fee generation across multiple price zones
  - Captures trading activity at key levels
  - Adaptive to changing market conditions

### Risk-Based Allocation Framework

| Risk Profile | Low-Risk Allocation | Medium-Risk Allocation | High-Risk Allocation |
| :----------: | :-----------------: | :--------------------: | :------------------: |
| Conservative |       70-80%        |         20-30%         |         0-5%         |
|   Moderate   |       50-60%        |         30-40%         |        10-15%        |
|  Aggressive  |       30-40%        |         40-50%         |        20-30%        |

### Implementation Roadmap

1. **Initial Deployment** (Week 1):

   - Select pools based on risk tolerance
   - Deploy capital gradually over 3-5 days
   - Establish narrow ranges initially

2. **Optimization Phase** (Weeks 2-3):

   - Analyze initial performance
   - Fine-tune ranges based on observed trading patterns
   - Implement advanced strategies (Barbell, Cluster)

3. **Monitoring & Adjustment** (Ongoing):
   - Track key performance metrics
   - Rebalance positions according to strategy
   - Adapt to changing market conditions

### Compound Frequency Recommendations

| APR Range | Compounding Frequency | Expected Yield Enhancement |
| :-------: | :-------------------: | :------------------------: |
|   0-5%    |        Monthly        |          0.1-0.2%          |
|   5-20%   |       Bi-weekly       |          0.3-1.2%          |
|  20-50%   |        Weekly         |          1.0-3.5%          |
|   50%+    |       2-3 days        |         4.0-15.0%          |

### Dynamic Range Adjustment Strategy

For medium and high-risk pools, implement dynamic range adjustment based on volatility metrics:

1. **Volatility Expansion Trigger**:

   - If 7-day realized volatility increases >25% above 30-day average
   - Widen position ranges by 20-30%
   - Increase fee buffer allocation

2. **Volatility Contraction Trigger**:

   - If 7-day realized volatility decreases >25% below 30-day average
   - Narrow position ranges by 15-25%
   - Focus on capital efficiency

3. **Trend-Based Adjustment**:
   - During strong trend confirmation, bias range in trend direction
   - During consolidation, center range around price

## Conclusion and Final Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive analysis, we recommend a balanced approach to Raydium concentrated liquidity provision with the following core principles:

1. **Foundation in Stability**: Establish base positions in low-risk pools to generate consistent returns with minimal impermanent loss risk.

2. **Strategic Volatility Capture**: Allocate to medium-risk pools with exceptional volume/TVL ratios to maximize fee generation while maintaining reasonable impermanent loss risk.

3. **Tactical High-Yield Exposure**: Selectively deploy capital to high-risk/high-reward pools using advanced range strategies to balance fee generation with impermanent loss protection.

4. **Active Management**: Implement regular monitoring and rebalancing protocols tailored to the volatility profile of each position.

5. **Compound Aggressively**: Reinvest earned fees according to the optimal compounding frequency table to maximize long-term returns.

This strategy balances risk and return across the Raydium ecosystem while adapting to changing market conditions and capitalizing on the unique advantages of concentrated liquidity positions.
