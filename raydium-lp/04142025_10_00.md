## Market Overview

The Solana ecosystem has shown remarkable growth, with Raydium maintaining its position as a leading DEX. SOL is currently trading at $133.46, up 26.15% over the past 7 days. This bullish momentum provides favorable conditions for LP positions but requires careful risk management to mitigate impermanent loss.

SOL's strong performance relative to the broader market creates both opportunities and risks for liquidity providers. Our analysis indicates that SOL-paired pools with highly correlated assets offer an optimal balance of return and risk in the current market.
