## Strategy Comparison Table

| Strategy | Average APY | Estimated 30-day Returns | Estimated 90-day Returns | Risk Profile |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Conservative | ~15% | ~$125 | ~$375 | Low - Established protocols, high TVL |
| Balanced | ~40% | ~$333 | ~$1,000 | Medium - Mix of established and newer protocols |
| Aggressive | ~90% | ~$750 | ~$2,250 | High - Emissions-heavy, lower TVL pools |

## Additional Notes

- **Time-limited incentives**: Many high-APY pools like Aerodrome and Curve pools on Fraxtal have APYs primarily derived from token emissions that may decrease over time.

- **Cross-chain bridging risks**: The strategies involve multiple chains (Ethereum, Base, Fraxtal, Polygon), requiring bridging assets which carries additional security risks.

- **Stablecoin risks**: Different stablecoins have varying risk profiles - USDC and DAI are generally considered safer than newer stablecoins.

- **Impermanent loss**: The Uniswap V3 EUROC-USDC position has potential impermanent loss, though minimal between stablecoins with tight pegs.

- **Protocol maturity**: Protocols like Morpho Blue, Fluid, SparkLend, and Pendle have extensive audits and longer track records compared to newer options like DegenPrime.

## Disclaimer

DeFi involves significant risks including but not limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, stablecoin de-pegging, and protocol exploits. APYs are variable and past performance does not guarantee future results. This information is for educational purposes only, and you should conduct your own research before investing. Verify all information directly on protocol websites as APYs may have changed since this report was created.
