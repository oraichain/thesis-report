## Strategy Comparison Table

| Strategy | Average APY | Est. 7-day Return | Est. 30-day Return | Est. 90-day Return | Risk Profile |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Conservative | 5.6% | $10.77 | $46.58 | $140.00 | Low |

## Additional Notes

### Time-limited Incentives
- Aerodrome Slipstream's high APYs include temporary liquidity mining programs which may reduce over time
- Radiant V2's high lending yields are partially boosted by protocol incentives that may change
- Orca's USDE-USDC pool has promotional rewards that could end in the coming months

### Cross-chain and LP Risks
- Bridging assets across chains (especially to newer L1s like Sui) carries additional technical risk
- LP positions may experience impermanent loss if stablecoin pegs diverge significantly
- Base chain and Solana have lower transaction fees but potentially higher security risks than Ethereum

### Stablecoin-specific Risks
- USDE and sUSDe rely on staked ETH as backing, which could be impacted by Ethereum upgrades
- EURC is a regulatory-compliant euro stablecoin that may have different risk profile than USD stables
- Smaller TVL stablecoin pools may experience higher slippage during market stress

### Protocol Notes
- Ethena has undergone multiple security audits from top firms and maintains transparent collateral reporting
- Radiant V2 has experienced two exploits in the past year but has since remediated the issues
- Clearpool provides uncollateralized lending, which carries inherently higher risks
- Ensuro's insurance model offers high yields but relies on limited claim history

These investment strategies aim to provide a balanced approach to stablecoin farming, allowing the investor to choose their risk tolerance level while maintaining diversification across protocols, chains, and yield-generating mechanisms.
