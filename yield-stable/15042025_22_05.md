## Strategy Comparison Table

| Strategy | Average APY | Est. 7-day Return | Est. 30-day Return | Est. 90-day Return | Risk Profile |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Conservative | 8.3% | $4.79 | $20.75 | $62.25 | Low |
| Balanced | 18.9% | $14.54 | $63.00 | $189.00 | Medium |
| Aggressive | 31.0% | $17.88 | $77.50 | $232.50 | High |

## Additional Notes

- **Time-limited incentives**: Aerodrome's high APYs on EURC-USDC and USDZ-USDC are likely temporary and driven by emissions. Monitor these closely and be prepared to exit if rates drop significantly.

- **Cross-chain considerations**: Be aware that cross-chain strategies (Ethereum, Base, Aptos, Solana) involve additional gas costs and cross-chain bridging risks. Factor these into your return calculations.

- **Stablecoin risks**: 
  - USDe from Ethena is newer but has passed multiple audits and demonstrated stability.
  - EURC (Circle's euro stablecoin) may have more volatility vs USD.
  - USDZ is a newer Base-native stablecoin with less history.

- **Protocol risks**: 
  - Newer protocols like Aerodrome and Spectra offer higher yields but with higher smart contract risks.
  - Clearpool's uncollateralized lending model is inherently higher risk.

- **Yield sustainability**: Most higher yields (>20%) are heavily reliant on token incentives, which may decrease over time. The conservative strategy offers the most sustainable yields.

- **Recommended rebalancing**: Monitor the aggressive strategy weekly and the balanced strategy bi-weekly. The conservative strategy can be reviewed monthly.
