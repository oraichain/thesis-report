## Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Average APY | Est. 7-day Return | Est. 30-day Return | Est. 90-day Return | Risk Profile |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| Conservative | 7.1% | $13.65 | $59.17 | $177.5 | Low |

## Additional Notes

- **Time-limited incentives**: Yel Finance and Celeron have high APYs that may be subsidized by token emissions and could decrease significantly over time. Check for ongoing updates.
- **Cross-chain risks**: When using non-Ethereum chains like Sonic, Berachain, and Flare, be aware of potential bridging risks.
- **Token emissions**: Many of these protocols offer rewards in their native tokens, which can be volatile.
- **Stablecoin risks**: 
  - sUSDe is backed by staked ETH and has protocol risk from Ethena
  - USDZ (Base) is newer and less established
  - MSUSD has recovery risks if the peg is temporarily lost
- **LP risks**: LP positions in Velodrome, Aerodrome, and Beefy involve impermanent loss if there are peg fluctuations between the stablecoin pairs.
- **Yield sustainability**: Higher APYs on newer chains like Sonic and Berachain may not be sustainable long-term as more capital enters these markets.
- **Governance risks**: Protocols may change yield formulas or risk parameters through governance.

For the most conservative investment, focus on the established Ethereum protocols like USDe, Morpho Blue, and Aave. For more aggressive returns, the newer chains offer higher yields but with increased risk. Consider spreading investments across multiple protocols to reduce overall portfolio risk.
