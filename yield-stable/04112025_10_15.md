## Additional Notes

### Time-limited Incentives or Airdrops
- Venus FDUSD market has temporarily boosted APY that is likely unsustainable long-term
- Aerodrome on Base has AERO token incentives that may decrease over time
- Liqwid Finance has LQ token rewards that supplement lending yields

### Upcoming Protocol Changes
- Morpho Blue is actively expanding to more chains
- Base chain is growing rapidly and may lead to more stable liquidity for stablecoin pools

### Cross-chain Bridging or LP Risks
- Moving assets between chains involves bridge risks
- Consider using native stablecoins on each chain to avoid bridging when possible

### Risks Tied to Specific Stablecoins
- EURC has forex risk as it's pegged to Euro instead of USD
- FDUSD is a newer stablecoin with less history
- GHO is Aave's native stablecoin and depends on protocol adoption
- DJED on Cardano has algorithmic components that add risk

### Impermanent Loss Risks
- EURC-USDC pairs may experience impermanent loss due to EUR/USD exchange rate fluctuations
- Most pure USD stablecoin pairs have minimal impermanent loss risk

This investment report provides a balanced approach to stablecoin yield farming across multiple chains and strategies. Adjust allocations based on your risk tolerance and regularly monitor performance as DeFi yields can change quickly.
